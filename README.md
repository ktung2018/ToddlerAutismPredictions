# ToddlerAutismPredictions

Prediction of Toddler Autism based on 10 screening questionaires and other personal traits. This porgram uses descriptive and predictive analyses such as classification, clustering, regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNeighborClassifier etc. to estimate the predictive power of machine learning techniques in detecting autistic traits. Accuracy of each machine learning algorithm is evaluated and summarised using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, Model Precision, Model Recall scores, etc.

Findings: Use Feature importance to find the feature that is most relevant in detecting Toddler Autism:
          Based on the correlation score, whether the child will shos wigns of waning to comfort when someone else in the family is visibly upset, whereas whether the  
          family memeber has ASD has least importance.    
Findings: Given clean data, all machine learning algorithms applied for this dataset can make highly accurate predictions.    
Findings: For this dataset, Logistic Regression predicts with highest accuracy with a score of 1  on Model Train Accuracy, Model Test Accuracy, Model Precision,                    Model Recall, Model AUC. The other machine learning algorithms exhibit above 0.9 accuracy scores.
